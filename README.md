<h2>NanoboyAdvance</h2>

NanoboyAdvance is a Nintendo GameBoy Advance (TM) emulator written in C++17.<br>
The goal is to create a modern, accurate GameBoy Advance emulator while also being fast
and avoiding to sacrifice too much code quality.

Originally the emulator dates back to 2015, when I was an 18 years old high schooler and wanted to
learn C++ while also writing an emulator.
However in order to modernize/improve the codebase it is undergoing a rewrite at the moment.
If you wish to look at the code before this rewrite, check out the `v0.1` branch.
